Namecoin is a sample application and a tutorial developed for the Cosmos SDK (TODO: link). To provide a nice transition for existing SDK developers, we will demonstrate implementing the same application using CosmWasm. This is a useful tutorial to demonstrate basic concepts and apply the skills you learned in the introduction. We will also be producing another tutorial for deploying and using an ERC20 contract, which may be more familiar to those coming from an Ethereum background.

## Goal

TODO: copy from original namecoin

TODO: build out tutorial
